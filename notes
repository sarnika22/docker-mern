Containerisation - a software deployment process that bundles an application's code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure(makes application portable, so it can run on any device)

Docker - open-source containerization platform where all the bundles and dependencies are stored in a docker container, You can run the docker image as a docker container in any machine where docker is installed without depending on the operating system.

Docker file - it uses Domain Specific Language (DSL) and has instructions for creating a docker image. Docker file instruction should be in ORDER since "Docker Daemon" runs it from top top to bottom
	Docker Daemon - is a service that manages containers on the system. It is a text document that contains necessary commands for creating a docker image.

Docker image - a file comprised of multiple layers used to execute code in docker container. It acts as a set of instructions to build a docker container(like template). This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how.

Docker file -> docker image -> docker container

workdir /app - (working directory of container to be /app directory within the container) all the files are stored, all commands(all code) mentioned will run trough /app directory
